# Welcome to Spaceflights Docs


The ***Spaceflights Docs*** project is a prototype static documentation for the [space flight tutorial](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.html). I chose this project as many people will be familiar with it, or if not, can easily review it through the online documentation or run it using the `spaceflight starter`.

This static site is mostly manually edited to explore what functionality a documentation generator would need to cover. The [Prerequisites](prerequisites) and [Usage](usage) are only needed if you wish to locally generate the documentation and play with the `mkdocs` framework. Within the [data section](data/_Data_overview.md) you can explore the datasets used by this project. Extra points for those critical readers that can spot why `model_input_table` has grown to over 750k rows. [Parameters](parameters/data_science.md) make use of modular pipelines and the documentation can explain the detailed use of them. To explore the [pipelines](pipelines/_Pipeline_overview) a static version of Kedro-Viz has been included.

And finally there are some [more thoughts](doccreation.md) on wy I think documentation is important and how this could be useful.

!!! note
    Some of these pages are more mock documentation to give it some *meat*. Apologies if some points are repeated.
