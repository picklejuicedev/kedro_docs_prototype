# Goals of Spaceflights

The main goal for `spaceflights` is to get you up and running quickly with the Kedro framework. You will have explored writing `nodes` and `pipelines`, hopefullly created your first tests and played with modular pipelines and namespaces.

This modified project is based on the `spaceflight` `starter`, which was modified to hold this prototype documentation. The idea is to have a well known project as example for how a mix of automatically generated documentation can be mixed with manually entered pages or sections. 

So whilst currently it is all manually curated, the idea is to automate as many steps as possible, so the `docs-generator` can create placeholders for manual text as well as insert links to the automatically generated documents.

I have autogenerated the data pages, so you can have a peek at the notebooks. However, let's first get a clear picture what a good template may look like. How it can be implemented can follow later.
