# Goals of Spaceflights

The main goal for `spaceflights` is to get you up and running quickly with the Kedro framework. You will have explored writing `nodes` and `pipelines`, hopefullly created your first tests and played with modular pipelines and namespaces.

This modified project is based on the `spaceflight` `starter`, which was modified to hold this prototype documentation. The idea is to have a well known project as example for how a mix of automaticall generated documentation can be mixed with manually entered description. The `docs-generator` can then create the placeholders for manual text as well as insert links to the automatically generated documents.

The *how* is ommitted on purpose. Let's first get a clear picture what a good template may look like. How it can be implemented follows later.
