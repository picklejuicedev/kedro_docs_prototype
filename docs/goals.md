# Goals of Spaceflights

The main goal for `spaceflights` is to get you up and running quickly with the Kedro framework. You will have explored writing `nodes` and `pipelines`, hopefullly created your first tests and played with modular pipelines and namespaces.

This project is based on the `spaceflight` `starter`, which was modified to hold this prototype documentation. The idea is to have a well known project as example for how a to mix automatically generated documentation with manually entered pages or sections. 

So whilst currently it is mostly manually curated, the idea is to automate as many steps as possible, so the `docs-generator` can create placeholders for manual text as well as insert links to the automatically generated documents.

The data pages were generated using some scripts, so you can have a peek at the notebooks. Please leave comments on slack or create issues on the [github page](https://github.com/picklejuicedev/kedro_docs_prototype/issues).
